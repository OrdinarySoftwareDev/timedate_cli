# timedate_rb
* Info: The program uses an API for getting all of the info, meaning that I have absolutely no control over if it works, what locations are & aren't there etc.

timedate_rb is a simple program that shows you data about a certain location, written entirely in Ruby.
Created as a project to kill some time.

# How to use

It is recommended to run the code in a windows terminal (cmd.exe).
Make sure you have Ruby installed on your computer before running the code.

Run the code and enter your desired location. This can be a city name, world coordinates, or a whole country (shows summary for entire said country) For Northern America, you can use states instead of countries (ex. Huntsville, Alabama; San Mateo, California).

re-execute the program and try entering the location again. If your location exists, but you still encounter the error, try entering in it's coordinates.
